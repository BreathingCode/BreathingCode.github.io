<h2>What is Breathing Code?</h2>

Breathing Code is a conference at the intersection of art, performance and
computer programming.

<h3>Time & Place</h3>

<p>
  The conference will take place in <em>Frankfurt, Germany</em>.
  It will start with an evening event on <em>May 4, 2015</em>.
  All sessions will happen on <em>May 5, 2015</em>.
</p>


<h2>Whatâ€™s the conference about?</h2>

<p>
We aim to bring together a diverse set of presenters who all have one thing in
common: They will change program code live on stage!
</p>

<p>
Be it that they show their approach on how they solve a particular problem and
maybe showcase a specific set of tools while doing so.
</p>

<p>
Or that they use specialize live coding environments, like <a
  href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a> to change a system's behaviour
while it's running, to live code it.
</p>

<p>
This conference wants to bring all aspects of <em>live programming</em> together and
attract sessions from people of each of those fields. We want to explore what
live coding means as an interface between humans and computers
