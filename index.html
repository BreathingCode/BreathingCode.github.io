</p>

<h3>Time & Place</h3>

  It will start with an <a href="/venues.html#preparty">pre-event party</a> on <em>May 4, 2015</em>.
  All <a href="/venues.html#conference">conference</a> sessions will happen on <em>May 5, 2015</em>.
</p>


<h2>Whatâ€™s the conference about?</h2>

<p>
  We aim to bring together a diverse set of presenters who all have one thing in
  common: They will change program code live on stage!
</p>

<p>
  Be it that they show their approach on how they solve a particular problem and
  maybe showcase a specific set of tools while doing so.
</p>

<p>
  Or that they use specialize live coding environments, like <a
    href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a> to change a system's
  behaviour while it's running, to live code it.
</p>

<p>
  This conference showcases diverse aspects of <em>live programming</em>.
  We want to explore what live coding means as an interface between humans and
  computers.
