<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>
How do others solve programming problems, what do they think while writing code?
And how do people change running systems by live coding them? Watch people
change and evolve code and systems <span class="live-stress">live</span> on
stage. See for yourself how codes comes alive.
</p>

<h2>Whatâ€™s the conference about?</h2>

<p>
The term <span class="live-stress">live</span> in connection with <span
class="live-stress">programming</span> has several meanings. People can <span
class="live-stress">code live</span> in front of an audience in order to show
how they tackle problems, use their IDEs or craft solutions. <span
class="live-stress">Live Coding</span> on the other hand refers to programmable
systems whose state and behaviour is changed on the fly when certain programs
are being added, removed or modified. Creating music on-stage with computers is
one of the typical applications of <span class="live-stress">live</span> coding.
And finally there are programming environments which give <span
class="live-stress">instant &amp; live</span> feedback to whatever you are doing
with your code.
</p>

<p>
This conference wants to bring all aspects of <span class="live-stress">live
programming</span> together and attract sessions from people of each of those
fields.
</p>

<h2>When and Where</h2>

<p>
The conference will take place in <span class="live-stress">Frankfurt, Germany</span>.
It will start with an evening event on <span class="live-stress">May 4, 2015</span>.
All sessions will happen on <span class="live-stress">May 5, 2015</span>.
