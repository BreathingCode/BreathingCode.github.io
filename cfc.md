## About the Conference

Breathing Code is a one-day, one-track, non-profit conference about showcasing
projects and approaches that involve adapting systems and code, live and in front
of an audience.


## Call for Contributions

### Conference

We're inviting everybody to submit proposals for sessions in whatever format
they can think of, be it demos, presentations, talks etc. Keep in mind that
we're a one-day conference with only one track, though.

It boils down to one rule:  
*It must involve changing code live on stage.*

See below for a non-exhaustive list of topics that are interesting to us or

## Topics

The concepts of live coding and coding live cover a wide range of topics and
dyomains. We're looking for contributions from all of them in order to provide
our audience with as diverse impressions and inspirations as possible.

The following may serve as a non-exhaustive list of inspiration of possible
topics, that we deem relevant to the conference's audience.

- Programming techniques for live coding
- Technical challenges of live coding
- Programming languages, platforms and IDEs suited for live coding and coding live
- Programming on stage to teach or solve problems
- Live coding in other domains than music and art
- Live debugging and testing

Please consider contributing if you can tell the conference's audience something
about those or related themes and topics, that you deem relevant for the
[conference's vision](index.html)
