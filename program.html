<h3>Live-coded Pong</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">

  <p>
    In 2011 I discovered Jeremy Ashkenas' "little language that compiles into
    JavaScript" and ever since, I have been fascinated by CoffeeScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this session, we go back to the roots of arcade games and develop a Pong game
    for the browser. From scratch. In CoffeeScript. Without frameworks. We deal with
    keyboard input, drawing on the canvas, collision detection and sound.
  </p>

  <p>
    The session is heavily inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/105955605">Mary
      Rose Cook's presentation at Front-Trends 2014</a> which baffled me the first
    time I saw it. Watch me succeed or fail.

    <em>Gregor Gramlich</em> started coding on a Kosmos CP1 when he was nine,
    quickly followed by the C64 and later Amiga 1000 and 4000.
  </p>
  <p>
    In university he was mainly interested in theoretical computer science and
    stayed a little longer to finish with a PhD. At that time coding was not in
    focus, but always a hobby.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2007 Gregor has been more on the practical side of computer science and
    coding has become his profession, but he still considers it his hobby as well.

<h3>Repl Electric - End of Buffer</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">

  <p>
    Repl electric bind light, sound and poetry to their fingertips.
  </p>

  <p>
    A single programmer live coding music with Overtone, visuals with shaders
    and all bound together with Clojure and Emacs. Embracing an open model all
    the performance source is open and free for all to see:
    https://github.com/repl-electric/cassiopeia
  </p>

  <p>
    Abstraction is used in the code to create not just a useful
    domain specific language but plays with themes that inspired the synths
    and visuals. My musical style is ambient with a focus on simple
    handcrafted synths and multi voice progressions.

<h3>Live Capture The Flag</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">

  <p>
    I want to present and solve a CTF (capture the flag) challenge, a code
    puzzle if you will. Together with you, the audience. After a short
    introduction we'll live code together e.g. by you shouting
    thoughts/ideas/solutions to me on stage in order to solve the puzzle
    step-by-step and to finally get a virtual flag. I'll become more of a
    moderator then a speaker in this session as I'll navigate the audience
    through the challenge.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the first place it will be a fun session. But I'll also try to teach
    you a bit about web application security.
