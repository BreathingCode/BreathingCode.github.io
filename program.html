<h3>Live-coded Pong</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">

  <p>
    In 2011 I discovered Jeremy Ashkenas' "little language that compiles into
    JavaScript" and ever since, I have been fascinated by CoffeeScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this session, we go back to the roots of arcade games and develop a Pong game
    for the browser. From scratch. In CoffeeScript. Without frameworks. We deal with
    keyboard input, drawing on the canvas, collision detection and sound.
  </p>

  <p>
    The session is heavily inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/105955605">Mary
      Rose Cook's presentation at Front-Trends 2014</a> which baffled me the first
    time I saw it. Watch me succeed or fail.

  <p>
    <em>Gregor Gramlich</em> started coding on a Kosmos CP1 when he was nine,
    quickly followed by the C64 and later Amiga 1000 and 4000.
  </p>
  <p>
    In university he was mainly interested in theoretical computer science and
    stayed a little longer to finish with a PhD. At that time coding was not in
    focus, but always a hobby.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2007 Gregor has been more on the practical side of computer science and
    coding has become his profession, but he still considers it his hobby as well.

<h3>Repl Electric - End of Buffer</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">

  <p>
    Repl electric bind light, sound and poetry to their fingertips.
  </p>

  <p>
    A single programmer live coding music with Overtone, visuals with shaders
    and all bound together with Clojure and Emacs. Embracing an open model all
    the performance source is open and free for all to see:
    https://github.com/repl-electric/cassiopeia
  </p>

  <p>
    Abstraction is used in the code to create not just a useful
    domain specific language but plays with themes that inspired the synths
    and visuals. My musical style is ambient with a focus on simple
    handcrafted synths and multi voice progressions.

<a  name="live-ctf"></a>
<h3>Live Capture The Flag</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">

  <p>
    I want to present and solve a CTF (capture the flag) challenge, a code
    puzzle if you will. Together with you, the audience. After a short
    introduction we'll live code together e.g. by you shouting
    thoughts/ideas/solutions to me on stage in order to solve the puzzle
    step-by-step and to finally get a virtual flag. I'll become more of a
    moderator then a speaker in this session as I'll navigate the audience
    through the challenge.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the first place it will be a fun session. But I'll also try to teach
    you a bit about web application security.

<h3>Live Data Analysis with Moose</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">
  <p>
    Developers are data scientists. Or at least, they should be.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider this: 50% of the development time is typically spent on figuring
    out the system in order to figure out what to do next. In other words,
    software engineering is primarily a decision making business. Add to that
    the fact that often systems contain millions of lines of code and even more
    data, and you get an environment in which decisions have to be made quickly
    about lots of ever moving data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet, too often, developers drill into the see of data manually with only
    rudimentary tool support. This approach does not scale and it should not
    perpetuate.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this talk, I'll show live examples of how software engineering decisions
    can be made quickly and accurately by building custom analysis tools that
    enable browsing, visualizing or measuring code and data. All shown examples
    make use of the <a href="http://moosetechnology.org">Moose analysis
      platform</a>.

<a  name="tudor-girba"></a>
<div class="bio">
  <p>
    <em>Tudor Gîrba</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/girba">@girba</a> and <a
      href="http://tudorgirba.com">http://tudorgirba.com</a>) works as team and
    innovation lead at CompuGroup Medical Schweiz, and as an independent
    consultant.
  </p>

  <p>
    He leads the work on the <a href="http://moosetechnology.org">Moose platform
      for software and data analysis</a>, he founded the <a
      href="http://gt.moosetechnology.org">Glamorous Toolkit</a> project for
    rethinking the IDE, and he is a board member of the <a
      href="http://pharo.org">Pharo live programming environment</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He advocates that software assessment must be recognized as a critical
    software engineering activity. He developed the <a
      href="http://humane-assessment.com">humane assessment method</a>, and he
    is helping companies to rethink the way they manage complex software systems
    and data sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, Tudor developed the <a href="http://demodriven.com">demo-driven
      innovation method</a> as a combination of design thinking, idea
    prototyping and storytelling. He is applying it in multiple contexts varying
    from research labs to engineering companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2014, he won the prestigious <a href="http://aito.org">Dahl-Nygaard
      Junior Prize</a> for his work on modeling and visualization of evolution
    and interplay of large numbers of objects.

<a  name="functional-frege"></a>
<h3>Purely Functional Coding with Frege</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">
  <p>
    Frege is a Haskell for the JVM and as such it is different -
    fundamentally different. Superficially, it is different in the appearance
    of the code. More profoundly, it is different in the way we approach the
    implementation of features, the design, the testing, the whole development
    experience, and finally even how we generally approach computing.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this session Dierk will solve a development task with Frege live on stage.
    You will see how you can program without shared mutable state,
    without mutable state, and without any state at all!
    How to program with values instead of references. How to program without
    statements and assignments, and why you want to do so.

<h3>Intro to Live Coding Responsive Graphics</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">
  <p>
    Get hands-on experience with live-coding your own sound responsive graphics
    using Google Chrome. This session will be a crash-course introduction in how
    to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
    data, time, and randomness within OpenGL’s fragment shader.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will use self-built web-based OpenGL fragment shader language performance
    IDE, similar to <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">shadertoy</a> and <a
      href="https://github.com/overtone/shadertone">shadertone</a> to teach a
    short starter session on how to live-code visuals with sound responsiveness.
    Participants can follow along the coding (having a recent version  of Google
    Chrome installed is required for that).

<h3>Legacy Code Refactor</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">
  <p>
    Legacy code is everywhere. Even in your project - or at least in the project
    of one of your colleagues. One should clean up, shouldn't one, but how?
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting with just a few lines of legacy code, I will demonstrate live how to clean
    them up and at the same time minimizing the risk of adding new bugs.

  <p>
    <em>Sam Aaron</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/samaaron">@samaaron</a> and
    <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/">sam.aaron.name</a>)
    is a live coder who considers programming as performance and strongly believes
    in the importance of emphasising, exploring and celebrating creativity within all aspects of programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sam believes that a programming environment which has sufficient liveness,
    rapid feedback and tolerance of failure to support the live performance of
    music is an environment ripe for mining novel ideas that will not only
    benefit artistic practices themselves but also the computer industry more generally.
  </p>

  <p>
    In pursuit of this unique perspective Sam is the lead developer of Overtone
    and Quil, powerful live coding platforms for music and visuals.
    Sam is also the creator of Sonic Pi, a music live coding environment used
    to teach programming within schools.
  </p>

  <p>
    By day Sam is a Postdoc Researcher at the University of Cambridge Computer
    Laboratory and by night he codes music for people to dance to.
