<h3>Pong</h3>

<article class="session-abstract">

  <p>
    In 2011 I discovered Jeremy Ashkenas' "little language that compiles into
    JavaScript" and ever since, I have been fascinated by CoffeeScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this session, we go back to the roots of arcade games and develop a Pong game
    for the browser. From scratch. In CoffeeScript. Without frameworks. We deal with
    keyboard input, drawing on the canvas, collision detection and sound.
  </p>

  <p>
    The session is heavily inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/105955605">Mary
      Rose Cook's presentation at Front-Trends 2014</a> which baffled me the first
    time I saw it. Watch me succeed or fail.

  <p>
    <em>Gregor Gramlich</em> started coding on a Kosmos CP1 when he was nine,
    quickly followed by the C64 and later Amiga 1000 and 4000.
  </p>
  <p>
    In university he was mainly interested in theoretical computer science and
    stayed a little longer to finish with a PhD. At that time coding was not in
    focus, but always a hobby.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2007 Gregor has been more on the practical side of computer science and
    coding has become his profession, but he still considers it his hobby as well.
