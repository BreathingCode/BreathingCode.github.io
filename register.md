## Pre-Registration

Official registration is not open yet. You can pre-register for the conference
on May 4 and 5, in Frankfurt, Germany.

Pre-registration does NOT require you to attend, but it will give you at
least 24 hours early access to the official registration system,
which will open in March.

### Ticket Price

Tickets will cost a maximum of 250€ (plus VAT).

You can us reduce ticket prices, by [helping us find
sponsors](/sponsoring.html). For every 250€ in sponsoring that you help us
secure until the end of March, the price of every ticket will be lowered by 7€.
