### Hotels

It's trade show time in Frankfurt - like most of the time - so booking rooms
can get quite expensive. That's why we have reserved a contingent of rooms in
two hotels:

- [Mainhaus Stadthotel](http://mainhaus-frankfurt.de/en/): From here you can get
  to the venues using public transport within 10 minutes.
  There are 10 rooms reserved *till April 10* for 135€ per night (breakfast included).
  Just mention "Breathing Code" when booking your room to get this rate.
- [Tulip Inn Frankfurt Airport](http://www.tulipinnfrankfurtairport.com/en):
  This hotel is outside the inner city of Frankfurt, close to the airport. Since
  getting to the venues from here is complicated we will arrange transportation
  on the night of May 4 and the morning of May 5.
  There are 30 rooms reserved *till April 15* for 85€ per night (breakfast included).
  Just mention "Breathing Code" when booking your room to get this rate.

Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Breathing Code: Transport to venues">let us know</a>
in advance if you need transportation from Tulip Inn to the venues.
