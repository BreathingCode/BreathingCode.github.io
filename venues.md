### Hotels

It's trade show time in Frankfurt - like most of the time - so booking rooms can
get tricky and eventually more expensive than usual.

That's why we've reserved a block of rooms in two hotels. Just mention
"Breathing Code" when booking your room in one of those hotels.

- [Mainhaus Stadthotel](http://mainhaus-frankfurt.de/en/): From here you can get
  to the venues using public transport within ~10 minutes.
  There are *10 rooms reserved until April 10* for 135€ per night (breakfast included).
- [Tulip Inn Frankfurt Airport](http://www.tulipinnfrankfurtairport.com/en):
  We reserved *30 rooms reserved until April 15* for 85€ per night (breakfast
  included) at this hotel.  
  This hotel is outside the inner city of Frankfurt, close to the airport. Using
  public transport to get to and from this hotel, is therefore a bit tricky and
  takes some time. To make it easier for you, we'll arrange transportation on
  the night of May 4th and the morning of May 5th.

Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Breathing Code: Transport to venues">let us know</a>
in advance if you need transportation from Tulip Inn to the venues.
