We are very sad, but in the end it is the right thing to do: We've decided
to cancel Breathing Code 2015. Seven tickets sold is far from enough to make
ends meet.

Many thanks to all who supported us -- especially in the last week since Benjamin
[wrote about our dilemma](/2015/03/27/making-it-count.html). Thanks to all the
speakers who agreed to present, thanks to all the ticket buyers, thanks to
all who tweeted, retweeted and favored our tweets.

It will take us a while to lick our wounds. After that we'll think about what
to do differently next time.
