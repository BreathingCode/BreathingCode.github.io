[Johannes](https://twitter.com/johanneslink), my co-organizer, and I, we are fond
of transparency.

One testament of this, was today's publishing of our [breakdown of Breathing
Code's ticket price](/2015/03/27/about-the-price.html) and how the ticket price
gets reduced the more participants join the conference. And that you even get a
refund in case the price is reduced, after you've bought a ticket.


### Feasibility of the Conference

Another aspect we want and need to be transparent about, is the feasibility of
the conference.

Until now, a week after the registration has opened and a mere five weeks before
the event, only ~~two~~ *four* tickets have been sold.

And as we've noted in the already mentioned post ["About the
Price"](/2015/03/27/about-the-price.html), the calculated ticket price of 250€
assumes a mininum number of 35 participants. If there's even one participant
less than that, Johannes and myself, we have to pay the difference out of our
own private pockets, as the conference is a non-profit with no sponsors and no
reserves.


### To Cancel or not To Cancel?

So it's only natural, that we asked ourselves if it's really a good idea to risk
paying ~9000€, the complete price of the conference, minus the number of
maybe-not-so-many tickets sold.

Or if it's a better idea to cancel the conference now and only pay several
hundred € in cancellation fees.


### Making the Next Days Count

All this means, that *we've decided to cancel Breathing Code* on Wednesday
01-April-2015 (sorry, no april fool's joke), *if the number of tickets sold* until
then, *is still significantly below the minumum of 35*.


### Help Us, If You Want to See Breathing Code

If you'd like to see Breathing Code happen, then help us!

Help us, spread the word. Help us find sponsors. Help us sell tickets. Help us
by buying tickets. *Of Course, all tickets will be fully reimbursed in case
Breathing Code is cancelled!*

Thank you!
