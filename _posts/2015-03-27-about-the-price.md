We are aware that some of you consider 250€ (plus VAT) to be a fairly high price
for a single day conference with basically motivational contents. That's why
we want to explain a bit that number and what you can do to reduce it...

### Costs

Considering 50 people attending the party and the conference our expenses
will amount to approximately 9000 EUR. This includes
- the rent for both locations
- the food for both locations
- the rent for sound and electronics
- the team to capture the video, to live stream it and to produce the ready cut material for later streaming
- travel and accommodation for invited speakers and those that could not afford to come otherwise

### Income

Up to now, we have but a single sponsor (250€) so we have to attain the remaining
amount through the ticket price. Given a minimum number of 35 paying participants
that's almost exactly 250€ per person. In that calculation we've even
ignored that a small part of the price is going to the ticketing service as a fee.


#### Reducing the Ticket Price

If you can [help us to find more sponsors](/sponsoring.html) and if we exceed
the minimum number of 35 paying participants the ticket price
will be reduced accordingly - e.g. by about 30€ if we sell 40 tickets instead of 35.
You will profit from a price reduction even if you have already payed a different amount
because we will refund the difference between the price you paid and the price we
need to pay the bills.
