## Code of Conduct

### Inclusiveness

The primary goal of the Breathing Code conference is to be inclusive to the
largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds
possible.

### Safe Environment

As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

### Expected Behaviour

And so we invite all those who participate in the Breathing Code conference and
the community surrounding the conference to help us create safe and positive
experiences for everyone.

* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but
  disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
  experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration
  to turn into a personal attack.
* Be aware of the effect your words may have on others. We are a community of
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
  behavior aren't acceptable.

### Scope

This code of conduct applies to the Breathing Code conference itself and to all
digital spaces that are related to the conference, such as the Twitter Account etc.
