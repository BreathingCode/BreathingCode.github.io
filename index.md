### Vision

How do others solve programming problems? Watch them code live. And Participate.
Some software is always running. You have to live code them. Watch how people
code those programs live. And do the same.

### What’s the conference about?

The term “live” in connection with “programming” has two meanings. People can
code live in front of an audience in order to show how they tackle problems, use
their IDEs or craft solutions. “Live coding” on the other hand refers to
programmable systems the state of which is changed on the fly when certain
programs are being added, removed or changed. Creating music on-stage with
computers is one of the typical applications of live coding. This conference
wants to bring both aspects together and attract sessions from people who do
either or both.
