## Vision

How do others solve programming problems, what do they think while writing code?
And how do people change running systems by live coding them?
Watch people change and evolve code and systems <span class="live-stress">live</span> on stage. See for yourself
how codes comes alive.

## Whatâ€™s the conference about?

The term <span class="live-stress">live</span> in connection with <span class="live-stress">programming</span> has several meanings. People can <span class="live-stress">code live</span> in front of an audience in order to show how they tackle problems, use their IDEs or craft solutions.
<span class="live-stress">Live Coding</span> on the other hand refers to
programmable systems whose state and behaviour is changed on the fly when certain programs are being added, removed or modified. Creating music on-stage with
computers is one of the typical applications of <span class="live-stress">live</span> coding.
And finally there are programming environments which give <span class="live-stress">instant &amp; live</span> feedback to whatever you are doing with your code.

This conference wants to bring all aspects of <span class="live-stress">live programming</span> together and attract sessions from people of each of those fields.

## When and Where

The conference will take place in <span class="live-stress">Frankfurt, Germany</span>.
It will start with an evening event on <span class="live-stress">May 4, 2015</span>.
All sessions will happen on <span class="live-stress">May 5, 2015</span>.
