### Vision

How do others solve programming problems? Watch them code <span class="live-stress">live</span>. And Participate.
Some systems are always running. You have to <span class="live-stress">live</span> code them. Watch how people change those programs on the fly. And try the same.

### Whatâ€™s the conference about?

The term <span class="live-stress">live</span> in connection with <span class="live-stress">programming</span> has several meanings. People can <span class="live-stress">code live</span> in front of an audience in order to show how they tackle problems, use their IDEs or craft solutions.

<span class="live-stress">Live Coding</span> on the other hand refers to
programmable systems whose state and behaviour is changed on the fly when certain programs are being added, removed or modified. Creating music on-stage with
computers is one of the typical applications of <span class="live-stress">live</span> coding.

And finally there are programming environments which give <span class="live-stress">instant &amp; live</span> feedback to whatever you are doing with your code.

This conference wants to bring all aspects of <span class="live-stress">live programming</span> together and attract sessions from people of each of those fields.
